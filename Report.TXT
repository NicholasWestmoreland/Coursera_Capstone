Introduction/business problem section(Preliminary)
A existing American coffee company Coffee Inc is looking to establish an number of coffee shops in the city 
of Seattle, Coffee Inc is looking to find out which neighborhoods are suitable for setting up a coffee 
shops, those being neighborhoods that are have a relatively high number of venues that sell food and beverages 
ie Neighborhoods that have established food and beverage districts, but have relatively low number of 
coffee shops in those neigborhoods. 

Finding neighborhoods that meet these requirements will provide a good environment to establish coffee shops
without being subjected to excessive competition which could significantly increase the chance of failure of 
the venture, especially in to early stages of development.


Data Section(Preliminary)
The list of neighborhoods will be wrangled from a wikipedia page outlining all the neighborhoods in Seattle.
The latitude and longitude coordinates for each neighborhood will be determined with either a python package or 
an external website. Location data from the foursquare platform will be used to retrieve a certain number of venues in 
each neighborhood, venues such as restaurants, pubs, nightclubs, department stores, parks etc..

Once the venue data has been retrieved, the venues that are most commonly occuring in each neighborhood can be determined.
Once this has been determined, it will possible to identify which neighborhoods have a lot of venues that sell food and beverages 
such as e.g bars, restaurants, deli's etc. and also which do not have a lot of coffee shops venues. These neighborhoods
will be the targeted areas to focus efforts in finding locations to set up shops.
