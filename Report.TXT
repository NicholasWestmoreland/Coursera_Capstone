Introduction/business problem(Preliminary)

A car manifacturer CarX based in seattle in looking to improve or include certain safty features
in its vehicles and wants to look at the factors and conditions particular to the city that constibute to 
collisions. 

Historical collision data collected in Seattle city could be of great use here as
understanding what factors are the major constributers in the severity of accidents 
would provide a starting point in determining which features of its vehicles that need to be included or improved.
This would help to reduce road deaths, property damage and costs for the city and individuals, as well as
improving the car manifacturer's standing.


Data Section(Preliminary)

The data in question is collisions incidents in Seattle from 2004 onwards, all manner of collisions are included suchas vehicle, pedestrian 
and bicycle collisions. Each collision is given a severity rating based on whether there was injury during the collision or 
just or damage to vehicles/property. There are a number of other factors which influence the severity of the collision like number of people involved
the weather conditions at the time and the type of collision. 

In order to reach to goal of determining what safety features need to be improved upon, factors or features in the dataset that have the biggest
contribution to accident severity will have to be identified, not all of these factors will be of applicable to improving safety standards but 
some may be a good a good idication of where CarX needs to focus its efforts. In addition, not all of the data in the dataset will be especially 
useful, the collisions that do not include vehicles will not be used.
